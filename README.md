# Tokenizer & Subword Visualizer

A simple Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)-style tokenizer built from scratch, with a visualizer for how complex words are split into subwords.

## Why this matters

Tokenization is fundamental to how large language models (LLMs) understand and process text. Subword units help models handle unknown words, preserve meaning, and generalize better.

## Features

- Implements a toy subword tokenizer (BPE-style)
- Visualizes token splits for Dutch words
- Shows linguistic morphology in tokenization

## Future ideas

- Compare with HuggingFace tokenizer
- Add interactive token tree
